# SUA Working Group Meeting Agenda and Notes
**Date:** December 18, 2025 — 6PM EST
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Meeting via Discord in the Meetings channel**
## Agenda
1. **Feedback on Current Stack Use**
- Pain points, gaps
- Necessary follow ups
2. **Community Growth**
- Who needs to join us at this early stage, and how can we invite them to join us on discord?

3. **Working Group Organization**
- Role call (who’s here, who’s doing what)
    - Are there roles unnamed/unfilled?
    - Volunteers?
- Technical vs Non-technical topics/sharing
    - How should we handle knowledge transfer/diffusion among participants operating at different levels?
    - How do we avoid overload/overwhelm or making the space uninviting to less technical folks?
    - How do we invite people with important experience/perspective/audiences but less tech knowledge to participate?
    - How do we consider the communication to future end users who are not going to get involved but we hope to adopt SUAs
    - **BUT ALSO** - what is the non-technical knowledge and experience that needs to transfer back to the group for consideration/design of the standard so we are anchored to real problems/needs
    - **Tech Examples:**
        - Client vs Server
        - Data ontologies/schemas
        - Principle of Least Authority
        - Object Capabilities

    - **Non-Tech Examples**
        - Barriers to organizing/activism/protest
        - COINTELPRO / what happened to BLM
        - How ICE is using surveillance tech
        - How Age Verification laws cause harm
        - Not everyone has government ID
        - Complexities of children on the internet
        - End user communication/clarity in consent interactions around security and data sharing (agreeing to things you don't understand)
    - Suggestions:
        - Podcast
        - Blog posts
        - Subreddit
        - Resource list (videos/articles/other groups)

## Minutes/Notes
1. **Community Tools & Platform Setup**
- Discord working despite first-time user onboarding challenges
- Several participants struggled with initial setup
- Successfully accommodated 8-9 participants total

2. **Communication platforms established:**
- Reddit for long-term discussion artifacts (approval-required posting)
- GitHub for meeting notes and archival content
- Discord for real-time coordination
- Monthly news posts concept for Reddit to avoid content flooding? Decided to revisit later in meeting to figure out better reddit set up.

3. **Server User Agent Vision & Architecture**
- Local-first approach with cloud hybrid model discussed
- M4 Mac Mini with 32-64GB unified memory sufficient for decent local models
- Preference for warrant-required local boxes vs cloud storage
- Cloud component still needed for accessibility (Gmail-level ease)

4. **Hardware integration possibilities:**
- Steam Deck as potential platform
- Synology NAS integration (Plex model)
- Nvidia dedicated units for local AI models

5. **Interoperability focus for IIW demo planning**
- Participant Diversity & Knowledge Transfer
- Current mix includes technical, UX design, social justice, and content distribution perspectives

6. **Knowledge bridging challenges identified:**
- Technical concepts (object capabilities, consent UX) to non-technical participants
- Social justice implications (surveillance, activism barriers) to technical implementers
- Low Friction/Practical Political education component emphasized for collective understanding
- Use case development critical for broader communication

7. **Next Steps & IIW #42 Planning**
- IIW April attendance confirmed for multiple participants
- Demo planning in progress:
- First Person Project credential scanning/verification
- Content upload tied to first person graph
  
**Goal: Multiple interoperable server user agents (stretch target)**

8. **Gradient of success defined:**  
- Communicate goals clearly
- Demonstrate individual solutions
- Show interoperability (ideal outcome)

9. **Subreddit population needed:**
- Ecosystem mapping of related projects
- Use cases for different audiences (artists, activists, etc.)

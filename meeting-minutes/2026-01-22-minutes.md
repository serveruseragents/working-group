# SUA Vision Sub Group Meeting Agenda and Notes
**Date:** January 22 2026 — 4PM EST  
**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Meeting** via [SUA Discord in the Meetings channel](https://discord.gg/MrhtzuT6Ev)

## Agenda

**1. Review [Defects and Mending](https://github.com/serveruseragents/working-group/blob/37f9557048281bae3f198edc26d86b994b9dd085/governance/defectsandmending.md)**

- The Defects and Mending document defines process and design patterns we explicitly avoid because they reliably produce exclusion, fragility, or harm in infrastructure.   

- Proposals that exhibit documented defects must be revisited or explicitly justified.

**2. Review and discuss the [initial charter](https://github.com/serveruseragents/working-group/blob/de6c06afbdb98af53be9eb9ab5bc70dc24f84eae/governance/charters/visioncharter.md)**

**3. Define time-bounded mandate**
   
- End conditions or triggers for review

**4. Brainstorm Objectives**

- Will organize the objectives later
- Share not only the objective but what that actually looks like when achieved, an example, etc
   
**5. Decide meeting cadence and asynch workflow**

# SUA Working Group: Technical Sub-Group 
## Vision, Goals, and Principles

**1. Vision**

Server User Agents enable an internet that supports human life in the physical world rather than displacing it. The vision of this working group is to ensure that SUA infrastructure strengthens human capability, trust, and coordination across diverse realities, while remaining accessible, intelligible, and grounded in human dignity.

This group exists to support SUA development achieve the goals of the visioning team while also steering it in the direction that aligns the goals with the right technical patterns. Technical experts are often in the best position to know what is possible, what is secure, and how some decisions can have meaningful impacts on practical implementation and adoption.

**2. Why We Exist**

The internet increasingly mediates everyday life, yet much of today’s infrastructure prioritizes attention capture, surveillance, and abstraction from physical reality. This has introduced friction between digital and physical life, weakened trust, and excluded many people from systems that increasingly govern access and participation.

Server User Agents represent a structural shift in how digital infrastructure can operate. Rather than centering browsers and continuous engagement, SUAs aim to support real-world activity such as in-person interaction, local commerce, task coordination, credentialed trust, and navigation of physical environments.

Technical people, governments, and corporations largely dictated how this was built the first time around. In many cases, choices were made simply to get it working in the first place, or to maintain backwards compatibility, or to benefit the government or corporations that funded the efforts. As the internet evolves and touches every part of our lives, we have the opportunity to reshape it. In this evolution, technologists will continue to have a deep and important role, but the steering and governance and priorities belong with everyone. Our focus is enabling and manifesting that collective vision.

**3. What We Do**

The Technical Sub-Group operates alongside the visioning group. While the visioning group focuses on defining and evaluating what SUAs must enable, and protect, etc. it is the job of the technical group to map that vision to reality, as well as fueling possibilities and richer understanding for the visioning group to consider.

Areas of focus include:

- TODO


**4. Goals**

The goals of the the technical subgroup are to:

- TODO

**5. Guiding Principles**
*Note: I've kept the same guiding principles as the vision subgroup for now*

This subgroup’s work is guided by the following principles:
- Technology should facilitate human capability and connection rather than replace or diminish it.
- Edge cases are not exceptions but people whose needs reveal system limits.
- Digital infrastructure should recede into the background of physical life rather than compete for attention.
- People should understand what infrastructure does on their behalf and retain meaningful control over it.
- Infrastructure shapes society, and design choices carry collective consequences.
- Interactions mediated by this infrastructure should reinforce autonomy, respect, and human dignity.

**6. How We Work With the Vision Subgroup**

The Vision and Technical subgroups operate in deliberate tension and mutual accountability.

This vision group contributes lived-experience scenarios, user stories, accessibility requirements, social impact analysis, harm identification, and real-world business and institutional use cases. It consistently asks whether proposed systems materially improve life as it is actually lived.

The technical group contributes architectural constraints, implementation realities, tradeoffs, and feasibility assessments. It evaluates whether proposals can be built, secured, maintained, and scaled.

This is not a handoff process. Neither group owns the vision independently. The system emerges through ongoing dialogue, critique, and iteration.

**7. Who Participates**

**Anyone.**

Where the vision subgroup states "Everyone", I think here its useful to say "Anyone". The vision subgroup operates from the perspective that we need the representational involvement of everyone in order to present a vision with maximal perspective. The vision group centers discussion for a non-technical audience and keeps that in mind during those group meetings.

The technical subgroup is meant to be where technical discussion can be centered and allow for going deep without as much explanatory work or fear of derailing vision discussion by going into the weeds. This does not obviate the need for overall cooperation and seeking opportunities for teaching and learning from each other.

Anyone is welcome to participate in the technical subgroup, even those who do not have a strong technical background. The group is meant to be welcoming, and help bring anyone up to speed who wants to be involved technically. However, it is not the responsibility of the group to make sure everyone is up to speed in order to have conversation. Just as we take care for technical concerns not to derail the vision subgroup, we should take care not to derail the technical subgroup. Not all education can happen within technical subgroup meetings, and if there is too big a gap in understanding sometimes it may be appropriate to hold questions and get guidance to resources etc. as opposed to addressing in the moment.

It benefits our cause to help bridge non-technical or beginning-technical members into understanding some of the deeper technical concerns or possibilities, because that feeds back into the visioning group and self-determination to create the best outcome.

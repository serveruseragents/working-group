# SUA Working Group: Vision Sub-Group 
## Vision, Goals, and Principles

**1. Vision**

Server User Agents enable an internet that supports human life in the physical world rather than displacing it. The vision of this working group is to ensure that SUA infrastructure strengthens human capability, trust, and coordination across diverse realities, while remaining accessible, intelligible, and grounded in human dignity.

This group exists to anchor SUA development in lived human experience. It assumes that people who live with the consequences of infrastructure decisions are necessary participants in shaping those decisions.

**2. Why We Exist**

The internet increasingly mediates everyday life, yet much of today’s infrastructure prioritizes attention capture, surveillance, and abstraction from physical reality. This has introduced friction between digital and physical life, weakened trust, and excluded many people from systems that increasingly govern access and participation.

Server User Agents represent a structural shift in how digital infrastructure can operate. Rather than centering browsers and continuous engagement, SUAs aim to support real-world activity such as in-person interaction, local commerce, task coordination, credentialed trust, and navigation of physical environments.

For this shift to succeed, technical feasibility alone is insufficient. Infrastructure that affects everyone must be shaped with everyone, not only through representation but through direct participation.

**3. What We Do**

The Vision Working Group operates alongside the technical group. While the technical group focuses on designing and building the system, this group focuses on defining and evaluating what that system must enable, protect, and improve in real-world use.

Areas of focus include:

- Business and organizational use, including how people actually interact with institutions, handle credentials, establish trust, and complete tasks
  
- Psychosocial impact, including how infrastructure shapes behavior, relationships, norms, and power, as well as unintended consequences
    
- Pro-social design, with attention to how systems reduce harm or amplify it, and how they affect both individual and collective life
    
- Universal accessibility, understood as direct participation by children, elders, disabled people, people with cognitive limitations, people with low technical literacy, and people operating under constraint
    
- Real-world facilitation, evaluating whether digital systems genuinely make physical life easier, safer, and more connected

The group works at both conceptual and practical levels, producing principles while testing them against concrete, real-world scenarios.

**4. Goals**

The goals of the the vision subgroup are to:

- Ground SUA development in the lived realities of the people who will use and depend on the infrastructure.

- Ensure that accessibility is addressed through direct involvement rather than proxy advocacy alone.

- Identify social, behavioral, and power-related risks before they are embedded into core architecture.

- Translate lived experience into concrete user stories and operational scenarios that technical teams can evaluate.

- Evaluate proposed systems against real-world conditions rather than idealized or assumed user models.

- Maintain alignment between long-term human outcomes and short-term technical tradeoffs.

**5. Guiding Principles**

This subgroup’s work is guided by the following principles:

- Technology should facilitate human capability and connection rather than replace or diminish it. 

- Edge cases are not exceptions but people whose needs reveal system limits.

- Digital infrastructure should recede into the background of physical life rather than compete for attention.

- People should understand what infrastructure does on their behalf and retain meaningful control over it.

- Infrastructure shapes society, and design choices carry collective consequences.

- Interactions mediated by this infrastructure should reinforce autonomy, respect, and human dignity.

**6. How We Work With the Technical Group**

The Vision and Technical subgroups operate in deliberate tension and mutual accountability.

This group contributes lived-experience scenarios, user stories, accessibility requirements, social impact analysis, harm identification, and real-world business and institutional use cases. It consistently asks whether proposed systems materially improve life as it is actually lived.

The technical group contributes architectural constraints, implementation realities, tradeoffs, and feasibility assessments. It evaluates whether proposals can be built, secured, maintained, and scaled.

This is not a handoff process. Neither group owns the vision independently. The system emerges through ongoing dialogue, critique, and iteration.

**7. Who Participates**

**Everyone.**

This working group treats use of the internet itself as relevant expertise. Participation is not limited to professionals, advocates, or intermediaries. Children, elders, disabled people, people with low literacy, people operating under economic or social constraint, business owners, caregivers, and people who simply use digital systems to live their lives all have standing here.

People may contribute by speaking from experience, questioning assumptions, responding to proposals, or describing how systems fail or succeed in practice. Formal roles and credentials are secondary to lived reality.

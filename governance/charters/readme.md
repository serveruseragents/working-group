# Charters

This folder contains charters, vision statements, and guiding documents that define the purpose, scope, and human constraints of Server User Agent development.

Charters in this folder describe:
- Why a given working group exists
- What problems it is responsible for addressing
- The principles and goals that guide its contributions
- How it interfaces with technical decision-making

They are intended to be stable, referenceable, and reviewed deliberately. Changes to these documents should be treated as changes to system intent.

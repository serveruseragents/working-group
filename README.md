# Server User-Agents Working Group
This is a repository dedicated to facilitating the Server User-Agents working group. For more info, see https://its.whenthetimeca.me/p/for-server-user-agents

## Guide to Resources

The original group began as a simple Signal chat during the 41st IIW. After our first official meeting, we decided on the use of some other resources beyond the Signal group, where most of the activity will be. This document is a guide for how to use these resources.

### Signal Group

For the time being we are utilizing the original Signal group as an organic entrypoint based on word of mouth. This means we are not publishing the link to the group, and it should only be shared or used to invite people that you know.

The Signal group is not a very easily accessible or conducive tool for moderated or threaded discussion and is bad for long term archiving/searching. Therefore the main purposes of Signal will be for private DMs and group messages (rarely needed) and as a way for people to show their membership of the working group when joining the Discord.

### Discord Group

This is the primary discussion tool. While Discord doesn’t have a great reputation for privacy, it is well tuned for our purpose and widely used by the broader community, which we want to be able to invite more easily into conversation.

Entrance into the Discord Group requires answering some questions and approval, but is meant to create an environment with a little more intimacy and trust/knowledge of each other more than it is meant to be a barrier to new people getting involved.

The Discord is meant to enable the community to self-organize discussion in the forum channels and use the chat channels for real time conversation when needed.

### SUA Subreddit

[Server User-Agents Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ServerUserAgents/)

While the Discord discussions are meant to be more self-organizing, we want to use the Subreddit as a more curated place for threaded discussion that we want thoughtful to get the widest participation in.

The Subreddit will require approval for posting but not for commenting. The intention is to take, from the self-organized conversation, certain topics that are deserving of long form, thoughtful, threaded discussions. For example, after our first formal meeting, there were 2 discussion topics that were highlighted for making progress. These would make excellent Subreddit posts: 

1. **Related Projects & Ecosystem Map** \- crowd sourcing a list of projects related to or embodying some aspect of SUA’s so that we can start finding the intersections  
2. **User Stories Collection** \- crowd sourcing user stories of what you could do with an SUA so that we start collectively visioning what it should (and maybe shouldn’t) do

There would likely be only a few posts a week at most, with the idea that this where we can get higher access, but lower frequency discussion topics for those who would struggle to participate at the discord level, and to raise the signal/noise for people with lower capacity but meaningful feedback.

### Github Repository
YOU ARE HERE!
[Github Repository](https://github.com/serveruseragents/working-group)

While this is not an open source project, it is useful to have a widely accessible source of truth for archival documentation: meeting minutes, specification drafts etc.

The landing page of the project README (this document) can be used for links and SEO and pointing people in the right directions. Beyond that, we have a folder for meeting minutes which is updated every time we meet. In the future there will likely be other purposes.

Here’s a link to our first meeting minutes:
